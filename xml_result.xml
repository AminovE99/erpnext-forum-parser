        <title>Stock balance report not showing any data</title>
        <text>I just installed erpnext on digital ocean. Stock balance report is not showing any data. However stock
            ledger is showing the correct data

            I got following issue in error log

        <title>Quality Inspection REading</title>
        <text>I am trying to set up the Readings table to that when a new Quality Inspection is created the status
            defaults to In Process. I used the customize form to set my options to

            In Process
            Accepted
            Rejected

            And set the Default to In Process but it always comes up as Accepted when a new doc is created.

            Any tips? I tried using a custom script to flip the option to In Process but it doesn't work either

        <title>FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of
            memory
        </title>
        <text>Hi Guys!

            Trying to update from Version 11 to Version 12.

            Did a bench switch-to-branch version-12 and everything was running smoothly until the process quit due to an
            Error: FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of
            memory.

            I've been researching on possible options to solve this, I already have the latest version of Nodejs and
            Yarn 1.5.1.

            Any idea of how I would be able to solve this. I've read a couple of blogs where they say that the ```
            --max-old-space-size=4096 should be put before calling the node process, but I don't see how I can get that
            to work when the files are being requested from frappe.io.

            Also, I believe this maybe more Yarn related, but I do not have the sufficient knowledge with either
            software to be able to get to a proper solution.

            Any help is greatly appreciated!

            Thanks!

        <title>How to set Auto Re-Order Level for multiple warehouses?</title>
        <text>I can't really get the grasp of Auto Re-Order Level. Can somebody explain how you would set the following
            scenario:

            Let's say the company has 2 shops (shop-1 and shop-2) and a central warehouse.
            * Shop-1 should re-order item X when it has only 1 left. Then it should get 2x item X from central.
            * Shop-2 is bigger, so it should re-order item X when it has 5 left. Then it should get 5x item X from
            central.
            * Central should re-order item X when it has only 7 left. Then it should purchase 10x item X.

            Would the following be correct?

            **Check in (group) | Request for | Re-order Level | Re-order Qty | Material Request Type**
            All Warehouses | central | 7 | 10 | Purchase
            All Warehouses | shop-1 | 1 | 2 | Transfer
            All Warehouses | shop-2 | 5 | 5 | Transfer

        <title>Product/Item configurator</title>
        <text>Hello everyone,

            first of all, I want to thank the frappe/erpNext-Team. We are still inexperienced with expNext and at the
            moment our IT-guy and I testing the system in our spare time and we are really impressed.
            I would like to change our existing system for the order management, quotation and invoicing with this
            system.

            **_- Short background story, why we need an item-Configurator_**
            (you don´t have to read this, the main question is below)

            Nearly all functions we need are already integrated, but the most important “option” that we need is a
            “item-Configurator”.
            We are selling electronic parts which have to be customized for each application with some hardware and
            software options. Behind the most options there are different prices, so the configurator has to calculate
            the correct price for it.

            The “variant” option is nearly that, what we would need. But it´s not able, to create the needed item in a
            quotation or sales-order and calculate automatically the price for this. The idea to create every possible
            item is not useful, because the different models (we are selling approximately 70 different models that can
            be configured with 5-37 “attributes” where you can choose up to 30 different options. That would be some
            billion items/variants…)

            While I was searching for a solution I found the “radplusplus” configurator from @Rene_Mailloux what is
            really close to that, what I´m searching.
            Unfortunately we were not able to install this app correct into our test-System. We have the option in the
            Stock-Part to activate the configurator, but it´s not able to see this option in the editing-row at
            sales-order. Also the possibility to tag a price for each option is not given, so it´s not what we are
            looking for…

            **_The interesting part:_**

            Unfortunately, I´m not so good with the system and don´t know if I understand it correctly, so I would be
            very grateful if someone with more experience could read my idea and give me a feedback, if I could put it
            this way, or if it is a total nonsense.

            **- How the configurator should work: (nearly like “variant” in the standard system)**
            o Add new items (Product-Model) in the stock an mark them as “configurable”
             If this is marked, you have a table where you can add the attributes with all options and the individual
            prices for this option
             The item-price will be calculated by the base price of the model and the selected options
            o You can choose the Config-Item for quotations, salesorder… and edit the config by open the “editing raw
            tab” (like it should work in “radplusplus”)
            It will calculate the actual price and save the configuration for this costumer
             The “costumer-config-save” must be able to read back, because it often happens that in an offer only minor
            things have to be changed, or in a follow-up order only one value has to be changed. so it is extremely
            useful if you do not have to recreate the complete code, instead you can choose a config that has already
            been ordered by the customer

            **- My idea to create an item-Configurator (don´t know if it´s a good idea)**
            o Create DocType called something like: “item config”, “item config save”, “item config attribute”
            o Add the option “Configurable” in the “item”, “Sales Order Item”… form. If it´s not selected, the
            configurator will be hidden, like the variants
            - if “Configurator” is “1”, you will not able to set a price for this item. This must be calculated by the
            “Configurator”

            Could this be possible do create the Configurator only with standard “customization” (doctype, form…) or
            must be created an app for this?


            Best thanks in advance for your time and best regards from Vienna (Austria),
            Matthias

        <title>Sales Return / Credit note. Why so complicated!?</title>
        <text>Hi,
            I'm trying to understand better the refund process in Erpnext because everytime it's a pain.

            Let says, I have a Sales order for an in stock item. Item is delivered with delivery note. Sales invoice is
            created and paid.

            Now the customer want to return 1 item and but something new.

            1. I need to go in the sales invoice and make a Return / Credit note. Then it create a negative balance on
            the customer account.
            2. I need to go to the delivery note to create a Sales return (to restock the item because it's not possible
            to do it in the Credit note directly).
            3. I need to close the sales order because it's now open and incomplete because I now I one item not
            delivered.
            4. I create a new invoice for the customer BUT I can't apply the negative balance on his account the the
            invoice. Payment reconcillaiton tool doesnt work either for that.
            5. Go to journal voucher to make a entry to apply the payment to the invoice so the outstanding amout is
            right.
            6. Enter customer payment to close this invoice.

            Am I missing something or this is really complicated? How can I learn this to an employee and make sure he
            dont forget anything and dont forget to put the item back in stock so the inventory balance...

        <title>New dashboard chart type - Lists</title>
        <text>Hello everyone,
            Studying how the dashboards can help our companies learn more of what is happening around, we've found that
            one thing could be useful and that's to have a dashboard chart type in the form of lists.

            Here's a real scenario:

            We would customize the Lead statuses and make a dashboard chart that would display in a list all leads
            currently under a specific status.

            Now, I know that the Report Builder can do this very well, however, I am thinking of having these types of
            lists on a dashboard with other charts.

            Other secondary scenarios that could benefit our business at least:

            1. Upcoming events in the dashboard - as a List
            2. Best performing of a specific doctype - as a List - this could benefit the hospitality industry of which
            we are part as well

            Food for thoughts and comments :slight_smile:

        <title>Learning ERPNext / Frappe Technology to Develop and Customize [Resources]</title>
        <text>During this downtime, I am hoping to try and customize ERPNext so we can start using it within our
            organization.

            I was hoping to ask the community if they had any experience with any online courses that taught a similar
            JavaScript/Python development environment.

            I am not a complete novice to database with experience in Visual Basic / C++ programming and am familiar
            with javascript in web development html/css. Although I am new to web based database development. So the
            server side / client side is a bit different for me. Hoping to learn more about this development
            environment.

            Of course there is good videos to be found here:
            https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3bV5kx77HsVwtnlCeEi_A/videos
            the series starting here:
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCAMPcl7NKc&amp;t=28s
            Was very helpful, but unfortunately a lot of the way things work have changed with later versions of
            frappe/erpnext.

            The tutorial here:
            https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/tutorial
            Was very helpful as well.

            The user manual is great for familiarizing yourself with ERPNext.
            https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en

            I am watching a free course on python (willing to pay for resources as well) but that is strictly python and
            bouncing back and forth between python and javascript is a bit confusing for me. One of the first things I
            hope to do is call an API to upload some information from data within frappe/doctype. I am not sure if
            that's done in python or javascript within this environment. I'd guess pythonm but I can't even get my
            "hello world" program to work since I think the directory structure has changed in the latest version of
            frappe/erpnext. My local install doesn't match the tutorial on frappe dev.


            Read the FAQ about the partner program:
            https://erpnext.com/partners/plans
            It would be awesome if you could pay to be a partner and unlock some online development type training. Could
            be some income for the software to create online dev resources that can be unlocked with a paid membership.

            Hoping this thread can be a list for learning resources for people looking to customize this awesome
            software! Thanks for any input! If anyone found anything helpful, please share!

        <title>ERPNext install fails for Ubuntu 16 due to ansible missing</title>
        <text>Hello comunity. Work requires me to set up a new server with ERPNext. Since the upgrade to V12 however,
            the installation script has changed a little. I followed [these
            instructions.](https://github.com/frappe/bench/blob/master/docs/easy_install.md)

            Now I'm getting following error:
            ![ubuntu|690x208](upload://eJ71elYhRXjE16y31XaVfTBb7Eq.png)

            So apparently it stops when trying to install ansible. I then manually installed ansible using apt-get, but
            that didn't help, same error.

            Any tipps? Should I try to install ansible using pip?

            Purchase Inv PURINV003 Laptop 25 25

            Whereas Remaining Balance Qty is the column to identify the balance left after the stock is sold per
            transaction.

        <title>Multi company and the invoices series</title>
        <text>Hello;

            As we know that each company will have separated Chart of Account.

            But the problem that the naming serial for the invoices is not separated, and will cause to have
            discontinuity for the numbers when there is audit, this is not allowed.

            The only way to overcome this is to create new instance for each company but in this case, it will mot be
            possible to see all companies from one login (session), and will not be able even to use duplicate feature.

            So how to resolve this problem?
            It is not acceptable to have SINV-00001 and then SINV-00020, the audit will ask where is 2 and 3 and 4 ...
            etc, how did u reach for invoice SINV-00020 directly?!!!

            There should be a solution for this, otherwise it is not possible to use multi company and multi financial
            book.

        <title>Multiple conditions on Salary Structure with a single formula</title>
        <text>HI i wanted to know how to put multiple conditions with a single formula on ERPNEXT version 12.

            Example:

            Component 1: if base is greater than or equal to 5,000 but less than or equal to 10,000 then base * 0.01

            Component 2 if base is greater or equal to than 10,001 but less than or equal to 15,0000 then base * 0.02


            How can i express these condition on the salary structure? Kindly assist.

        <title>Salary Component Formula</title>
        <text>Hi everyone, I am not a programmer. I am still trying to figure out phyton coding.. How can I set the
            formula in Salary Component like below:

            When wages exceed RM800 but not exceed RM900, contribution amount is RM1.70
            When wages exceed RM900 but not exceed RM1,000, contribution amount is RM1.90
            When wages exceed RM1,000 but not exceed RM1,100, contribution amount is RM2.10
            .
            .
            .
            When wages exceed RM4,000, contribution amount is RM7.90


            Above mentioned wages is the total of basic salary, overtime pay, allowance, incentive and bonuses.

        <title>BOM import rate</title>
        <text>I would like to import BOMs into the system. I downloaded the template by exporting the BOM. There is a
            column in there called "rate". I'm a little confused by this MANDATORY COLUMN. If I was to create a new BOM
            manually, when I select the item to be part of the BOM the rate is AUTO filled for me based on what I have
            set for my "Rate Of Materials Based On". In my case "Valuation Rate." I would like the import to do the
            same. I don't want to write the value for my item I would like the system to calculate it for me.

            Is this possible? If not, is there a workaround? Can I enter 0 and go into the BOM manually to update the
            value?

            Thank you all. P.S. Yes I did look at the manual/docs.

            Nathan

        <title>Salary Formulate for Working Hour Based Salary</title>
        <text>Hi everyone,

            So currently i have 2 type of shift (normal &amp; overtime), and i want to pay my employee based on their
            total working hour per week/per month.

            At current system I set 2 shift type, normal (8-17) and overtime (17-24) and i thought i would use the late
            entry and late exit to adjust their working hour (if overtime end past 24 or before 24 or something like
            that). But i find i can't input the number for late entry/early exit to adjust that working hour.

            Other problem is i find the working hour on Attendance report is 0 even though i already set the shift type
            to the employee.

            From my problem above, i thought i don’t have Base Salary for my employee? Since their salary is paid based
            on Total working hour. Am i right?

            Hope someone can give insight to my problem.

            Thanks &amp; regards,
            Randy

        <title>How to Print Barcode Labels</title>
        <text>I need help on how to print barcode labels.

            I have designed a print format that contains just the product name and barcode

            The barcode is contained in an html script that converts the barcode number to barcode symbols.

            Works well and prints out the barcode as wanted.

            Unfortunately the only barcode font that works for me is "Libre Barcode", this font is not scanable by all
            barcode scanners.

            So though it prints, it is not scanning, basically useless.

            I would appreciate any idea on a way forward.

            Regards

        <title>How to account for returned payment to a supplier?</title>
        <text>Situation

            I have a **Purchase Invoice** from which I have created a __Payment Entry__.
            Now the supplier had change its bank account of, so the funds where returned from the overseas bank (because
            the bank account the payment was sent to does not exist any longer).

            How can I account for this correctly in ERPNext?

            I need to 'reopen' invoice (which is marked as paid) and also return the funds back on to our outgoing bank
            account (of course not all of it because both involved banks took a bite from the money).

            I was looking at journal entry but can not link that neither to a payment entry, nor to a 'paid' Purchase
            Invoice.

            Can anybody kindly advise how to handle such a scenario?

        <text>Hello All,
            I was exploring the Email Campaign feature.
            From what I understand, I have to manually create an Email Campaign for each Lead.
            Is there a way to automate this on creation of a Lead?
            Because if an organisation gets a lot of leads everyday, it would be tedious to create an Email Campaign
            manually for all the leads.
